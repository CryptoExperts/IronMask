This directory contains some gadgets that I use to test "stuffs". You
probably don't want to use them, as their content might differ from
their name (ie, it would be a mistake to think that `dom.sage`
contains a DOM multiplication (it might, but it might not)).

Still, it's convenient for me to keep them around, so here they are.
